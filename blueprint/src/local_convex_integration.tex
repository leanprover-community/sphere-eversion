\section{Local theory of convex integration}
\label{chap:local}
\subsection{Key construction}
\label{sec:convex_integration_intro}


The elementary step of convex integration modifies the derivative of a
map in one direction. The precise meaning of ``one direction'' relies on the
following definition.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:dual_pair}
  \leanok
  \lean{DualPair}
  A dual pair on a vector space $E$ is a pair $(π, v)$ where $π$ is a linear
  form on $E$ and $v$ a vector in $E$ such that $π(v) = 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:rel_slice}
  \leanok
  \lean{RelMfld.slice}
  \uses{def:rel_loc}
  For every $σ = (x, y, φ)$, the slice of $\Rel$ at $σ$ with respect to $(π, v)$
  is:
  \[
    \Rel(σ, π, v) = \{w ∈ F \;|\; (x, y, φ + (w - φ(v)) ⊗ π) ∈ \Rel\}.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:update_lin_map}
  \leanok
  \lean{DualPair.update_ker_pi, DualPair.update_v, mem_slice}
  The linear map $φ + (w - φ(v)) ⊗ π)$ coincides with $φ$ on $\ker π$
  and sends $v$ to $w$.
  If $\sigma$ belongs to $\Rel$ then $φ(v)$ belongs to
  $\{w ∈ F, (x, y, φ + (w - φ(v)) ⊗ π) ∈ \Rel\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\leanok
  These are direct checks.
\end{proof}

Let $E$ and $F$ be finite dimensional real normed vector spaces.
Let $f \co E → F$ be a smooth map, and let $(π, v)$ be a dual pair on $E$.
We want to modify $Df$ in the direction of $v$ while almost preserving it
on $\ker π$.
Say we wish $Df(x)v$ could live in some open subset $Ω_x ⊂ F$. Assume there is
a smooth family of loops $γ \co E × 𝕊^1 → F$ such that each
$γ_x$ takes values in $Ω_x$, and its average value $\overline{γ}_x = \int_{𝕊^1}
γ_x$ is $Df(x)v$ for all $x$. Obviously such loops can exist
only if $Df(x)v$ is in the convex hull of $Ω_x$, and we saw in the previous
chapter that this is almost sufficient (and we'll see this is sufficiently
almost sufficient for our purposes). Then we can modify $f$ to fulfil our wish
using the following construction.

\begin{definition}[Theillière 2018]
  \label{def:corrugation}
  \uses{def:loop}
  \leanok
  \lean{corrugation}
  The map obtained by corrugation of $f$ in direction $(π, v)$ using $γ$
  with oscillation number $N$ is
  \[
    x ↦ f(x) + \frac1N  ∫_0^{Nπ(x)} \left[γ_x(s) - \overline{γ}_x\right]ds.
  \]
\end{definition}

In the above definition, we mostly think of $N$ as a large natural
number.
But we don't actually require it, any positive real number will do.

The next proposition implies that, provided $N$ is large enough, we have
achieved $Df'(x)v ∈ Ω_x$, almost without modifying derivatives in the
directions of $\ker π$, and almost without moving $f(x)$.

\begin{proposition}[Theillière 2018]
  \label{prop:theilliere}
  \lean{fderiv_corrugated_map, corrugation.c0_small_on, remainder_c0_small_on, corrugation.support}\leanok
  \uses{def:corrugation}
  Let $f$ be a $\mathcal{C}^1$ function from $E$ to $F$. Let $(π, v)$ be a dual
  pair on $E$. Let $γ \co E × 𝕊^1 → F$ be a $\mathcal{C}^1$ family of loops
  such that $\overline{γ_x} = Df(x)v$ for all $x$.

  For any compact set $K ⊂ E$ and any positive $ε$, the function $f'$ obtained
  by corrugation of $f$ in direction $(π, v)$ using $γ$ with large enough
  oscillation number $N$ satisfies:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{CP:C0}
      $∀ x ∈ K, ‖f'(x) - f(x)‖ ≤ ε$
    \item\label{CP:kerpi}
      $∀ x ∈ K, ‖(Df'(x) - Df(x))_{|\ker π}‖ ≤ ε$.
    \item\label{CP:v}
      $∀ x ∈ K, ‖Df'(x)v - γ(x, Nπ(x))‖ ≤ ε$
  \end{enumerate}
  In addition, all the differences estimated above vanish if $x$ is outside the
  support of $γ$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  We set $Γ_x(t) = ∫_0^t \left(γ_x(s) - \overline{γ}_x\right)ds$, so that
  $f'(x) = f(x) + Γ_x(Nπ(x))/N$.  Because each $Γ_x$ is $1$-periodic, and
  everything has compact support in $E$, all derivatives of $Γ$ are uniformly
  bounded.  Item~\ref{CP:C0} in the statement is then obvious.
  Item~\ref{CP:kerpi} also follows since
  $∂_if'(x) = ∂_if(x) + ∂_iΓ(x, Nπ(x))/N$. In order to prove
  Item~\ref{CP:v}, we compute:
  \begin{align*}
      Df'(x)v &= Df(x)v + \frac1N ∂_jΓ(x, Nπ(x)) + \frac NN ∂_tΓ(x, Nπ(x))\\
                       &= Df(x)v + \bigO{\frac1N} + γ(x, Nπ(x)) - Df(x)v\\
                       &= γ(x, Nπ(x)) + \bigO{\frac1N}.
  \end{align*}
  Outside the support of $γ$, $Γ_x$ and its derivative with respect to $x$
  vanish identically (for the derivative computation, it is important that the
  support of $γ$ is the \emph{closure} of the set of $x$ where $γ_x$ is not
  constant).
\end{proof}

\subsection{The main inductive step}
\label{sec:inductive_step}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:hol_partial}
  \leanok
  \lean{JetSec.IsPartHolonomicAt}
  Let $E'$ be a linear subspace of $E$.
  A map $\F = (f, φ) : E → F × \Hom(E, F)$ is $E'$--holonomic if,
  for every $v$ in $E'$ and every $x$, $Df(x)v = φ(x)v$.
\end{definition}

We'll use the notation $\Conn_w A$ to denote the connected component of $A$
that contains $w$, or the empty set if $w$ doesn't belong to $A$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:short_formal_sol}
  \leanok
  \lean{RelLoc.FormalSol.IsShortAt}
  \uses{def:formal_sol_loc, def:dual_pair}
  A formal solution $\F$ of $\Rel$ is $(π, v)$--short if,
  for every $x$, $Df(x)v$ belongs to the interior of the convex hull of
  $\Conn_{φ(v)}\Rel((x, f(x), φ(x)), π, v)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:htpy_jet_sec_loc}
  \leanok
  \lean{HtpyJetSec}
  A $1$-jet section from $E$ to $F$ is a function from $E$ to $F × \Hom(E, F)$.
  A homotopy of $1$-jet sections is a smooth map
  $\F : ℝ × E → F × \Hom(E, F)$.
\end{definition}

Typically, $x ↦ \F(t, x)$ will be denoted by $\F_t$. It could seem more natural to take
$[0, 1] × E$ as the source of a homotopy but this would be less convenient for
formalization and wouldn't change anything since any map from $ℝ × E$ can be restricted to
$[0, 1] × E$ and every map from $[0, 1] × E$ could be extended.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:integration_step}
  \leanok
  \lean{StepLandscape.improveStep_rel_t_eq_0, StepLandscape.improveStep_rel_C,%
  StepLandscape.improveStep_rel_compl_K₁, StepLandscape.improveStep_c0_close,%
  StepLandscape.improveStep_part_hol}
  \uses{def:short_formal_sol, def:hol_partial, def:htpy_jet_sec_loc}
  Let $\F$ be a formal solution of $\Rel$.
  Let $K_1 ⊂ E$ be a compact subset, and let $K_0$ be a compact subset of
  the interior of $K_1$. Let $C$ be a closed subset of $E$.
  Let $E'$ be a linear subspace of $E$ contained in $\ker π$.
  Let $ε$ be a positive real number.

  Assume $\Rel$ is open.
  Assume that $\F$ is $E'$--holonomic near $K_0$, $(π, v)$--short,
  and holonomic near $C$.
  Then there is a homotopy $\F_t$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      $\F_0 = \F$~;
    \item
      $\F_t$ is a formal solution of $\Rel$ for all $t$~;
\item
      $\F_t(x) = \F(x)$ for all $t$ when $x$ is near $C$ or outside
      $K_1$~;
    \item
      $d(\bs\F_t(x), \bs \F(x)) ≤ ε$ for all $t$ and all $x$~;
    \item
      $\F_1$ is $E' ⊕ ℝv$--holonomic near $K_0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  \proves{lem:integration_step}
  \uses{prop:∃_loops, prop:theilliere, lem:update_lin_map}
  We denote the components of $\F$ by $f$ and $φ$.
  Since $\F$ is short, \cref{prop:∃_loops} applied to
  $g \co x ↦ Df(x)v$, $β \co x ↦ φ(x)v$,
  $Ω_x = \Rel(\F(x), π, v)$, and $K = C ∩ K_1$ gives us a smooth family of loops
  $γ \co E × [0, 1] × 𝕊^1 → F$ such that, for all $x$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $∀ t\, s,\; γ^t_x(s) ∈ \Rel(\F(x), π, v)$
    \item $∀ s,\; γ^0_x(s) = φ(x)v$
    \item $\bar γ^1_x = Df(x)v$
    \item if $x$ is near $C$, $∀t\, s,\; γ^t_x(s) = φ(x)v$
  \end{itemize}
  Let $ρ: E → ℝ$ be a smooth cut-off function which equals one on
  a neighborhood of $K_0$ and whose support is contained in $K_1$.

  Let $N$ be a positive real number.
  Let $\bar f$ be the corrugated map constructed from $f$, $γ^1$ and $N$.
  \Cref{prop:theilliere} ensures that, for all $x$,
  \[
    D\bar f(x) = Df(x) + \left[γ^1_x(Nπ(x)) - Df(x)v\right] ⊗ π +
             R_x
  \]
  for some remainder term $R$ which is $ε$-small and vanishes whenever $γ_x$ is
  constant, hence vanishes near $C$.

  We set $\F_t(x) = \big(f_t(x), φ_t(x)\big)$ where:
  \[
    f_t(x) = f(x) + \frac{tρ(x)}N \int_0^{Nπ(x)}
                    \left[γ^t_x(s) - Df(x)v\right]\, ds
  \]
  and
  \[
    φ_t(x) = φ(x) + \left[γ^{tρ(x)}_x(Nπ(x)) - φ(x)v\right] ⊗ π +
            \frac{tρ(x)}N B_x.
  \]

  We now prove that $\F_t$ has the announced properties, starting with
  he obvious ones.
  The fact that $\F_0 = \F$ is obvious since $γ^0_x(s) = φ(x)v$ for all
  $s$.

  When $x$ is near $C$, $Df(x) = φ(x)$ since $\F$ is holonomic near
  $C$.
  In addition, $γ^t_x(s) = φ(x)v$ for all $s$ and $t$, hence $B_x$ vanishes.
  Hence $\F_t(x) = \F(x)$ for all $t$ when $x$ is near $C$.

  Outside of $K_1$, $ρ$ vanishes. Hence $f_t(x) = f(x)$ for all $t$,
  and $γ^{tρ(x)}_x(s) = φ(x)v$ for all $s$ and $t$, and $φ_t(x) = φ(x)$.

  The distance between $f(x)$ and $f_t(x)$ is zero outside of $K_1$
  and $ε$-small everywhere.

  We now turn to the interesting parts.
  The first one is that each $\F_t$ is a formal solution of $\Rel$.
  We already now that $\F_t$ coincides with $\F$, which is a formal
  solution, outside of the compact set $K_1$.
  We set
  \[
    \F'_t(x) = \left(f(x),
                     φ(x) + \left[γ^{tρ(x)}_x(Nπ(x)) - φ(x)v\right] ⊗ π\right).
  \]
  Since $\Rel$ is open, and $K_1 × [0, 1]$ is compact and $\F_t$ is
  within $\bigO{1/N}$ of $\F'_t$, it suffices to prove that $\F'_t$ is a formal
  solution for all $t$.
  This is guaranteed by the definition of the slice $\Rel(\F(x), π, v)$
  to which $γ^{tρ(x)}_x(Nπ(x))$ belongs.

  Finally, let's prove that $\F_1$ is $E' ⊕ ℝv$--holonomic near $K_0$.
  Since $ρ = 1$ near $K_0$, we have, for $x$ near $K_0$,
  \[
    Df_1(x) = Df(x) + \left[γ^1_x(Nπ(x)) - Df(x)v\right] ⊗ π +
             \frac1N B_x,
  \]
  and
  \[
    φ_1(x) = φ(x) + \left[γ^1_x(Nπ(x)) - φ(x)v\right] ⊗ π +
            \frac{1}N B_x.
  \]
  Let $p$ be the projection of $E$ onto $\ker π$ along $v$,
  so that $\Id_E = p + v ⊗ π$.
  We can rewrite the above formulas as
  \[
    Df_1(x) = Df(x) ∘ p + γ^1_x(Nπ(x)) ⊗ π + \frac1N B_x,
  \]
  and
  \[
    φ_1(x) = φ(x) ∘ p + γ^1_x(Nπ(x)) ⊗ π + \frac{1}N B_x.
  \]
  So we see the difference is $Df(x) ∘ p - φ(x) ∘ p$ which vanishes on
  $E'$ since $\F$ is $E'$--holonomic near $K_0$, and vanishes on $v$ since
  $p(v) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Ample differential relations}
\label{sec:ample_differential_relations}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:ample_codim_two}
  \uses{def:ample_subset}
  \lean{AmpleSet.of_one_lt_codim}
  \leanok
  The complement of a linear subspace of codimension at least 2 is
  ample.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  Let $F$ be subspace of $E$ with codimension at least $2$.
  Let $F'$ be a complement subspace.
  Its dimension is at least $2$ since it is isomorphic to $E/F$
  and $\dim(E/F) = \codim(F) ≥ 2$.
  First note the complement of $F$ is path-connected.
  Indeed let $x$ and $y$ be points outside $F$.
  Decomposing on $F ⊕ F'$, we get $x = u + u'$ and $y = v + v'$
  with $u' ≠ 0$ and $v' ≠ 0$.
  The segments from $x$ to $u'$ and $y$ to $v'$ stay outside $F$,
  so it suffices to connect $u'$ and $v'$ in $F' ∖ \{0\}$.
  If the segment from $u'$ to $v'$ doesn't contains the origin then we
  are done.
  Otherwise $v' = μu'$ for some (negative) $u'$.
  Since $\dim(F') ≥ 2$ and $u' ≠ 0$, there exists $f ∈ F'$
  which is linearly independent from $u'$, hence from $v'$.
  We can then connect both $u'$ and $v'$ to $f$ by a segment
  away from zero.

  We now turn to ampleness.
  The connectedness result reduces to prove that every $e$ in $E$
  is in the convex hull of $E ∖ F$.
  If $e$ is not in $F$ then it is the convex combination of itself with
  coefficient $1$ and we are done.
  Now assume $e$ is in $F$.
  The codimension assumption guarantees the existence
  of a subspace $G$ such that $\dim(G) = 2$ and $G ∩ F = \{0\}$.
  Let $(g_1, g_2)$ be a basis of $G$.
  We set $p_1 = e + g_1$, $p_2 = e + g_2$, $p_3 = e - g_1 - g_2$.
  All these points are in $E ∖ F$ and $e = p_1/3 + p_2/3 + p_3/3$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:h_principle_open_ample_loc}]
  \leanok
  \uses{lem:integration_step}
  This is a straightforward induction using \cref{lem:integration_step}.
  Let $(e_1, \dots, e_n)$ be a basis of $E$,
  and let $(π_1, \dots, π_n)$ be the dual basis.
  Let $E'_i$ be the linear subspace of $E$ spanned by
  $(e_1, \dots, e_i)$, for $1 ≤ i ≤ n$, and let $E'_0$ be the zero
  subspace of $E$.
  Each $(π_i, e_i)$ is a dual pair and the kernel of $π_i$ contains
  $E'_{i - 1}$.

  \Cref{lem:integration_step} allows to build a sequence of homotopies
  of formal solutions,
  each homotopy relating a formal solution which is $E'_i$--holonomic to
  one which is $E'_{i+1}$--holonomic (always near $K_0$).
  The shortness condition is always satisfies because $\Rel$ is
  ample.
  Each homotopy starts where the previous one stopped, stay at
  $C^0$ distance at most $ε/n$, and is relative to $C$ and
  the complement of $K_1$.

  It then suffices to do a smooth concatenation of theses homotopies.
  We first pre-compose with a smooth map from $[0, 1]$ to itself that
  fixes $0$ and $1$ and has vanishing derivative to all orders at $0$
  and $1$.
  Then we precompose by affine isomorphisms from $[0, 1]$
  to $[i/n, (i + 1)/n]$ before joining them.
