			<h1 id="what-is-it-about">What is it about?</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to formalize the proof of existence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY">sphere eversions</a> using the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean theorem prover</a>, mainly developed at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a> by <a href="https://leodemoura.github.io/">Leonardo de Moura</a>. More precisely we want to formalize the full <em>h</em>-principle for open and ample first order differential relations, and deduce existence of sphere eversions as a corollary.</p>
<p>The main motivations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrating the proof assistant can handle geometric topology, and not only algebra or abstract nonsense. Note that Fabian Immler and Yong Kiam Tan already pioneered this direction by formalizing Poincar√©-Bendixon, but this project has much larger scale.</li>
<li>Exploring new infrastructure for collaborations on formalization projects, using the <a href="blueprint/index.html">interactive blueprint</a>.</li>
<li>Producing a bilingual informal/formal document by keeping the blueprint and the formalization in sync.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploring-and-helping">Exploring and helping</h3>
<p>The best way to get started is to read the blueprint introduction, either in <a href="blueprint.pdf">pdf</a> or <a href="blueprint/sect0001.html">online</a>. Then have a look at the <a href="blueprint/dep_graph_document.html">dependency graph</a>, paying special attention to blue items. Blue items are items that are ready to be formalized because their dependencies are formalized. For lemmas, a blue border means the statement is ready for formalization, and a blue background means the proof is ready for formalization.</p>
<p>Once you spotted something to work on, make sure to discuss in on <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> before writing code. Once you formalized something, make sure the blueprint is still up to date, since it needs to evolve to its bilingual document final state.</p>
