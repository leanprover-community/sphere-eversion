  set K' : compact_exhaustion X := compact_exhaustion.choice X,
  set K : compact_exhaustion X := K'.shiftr.shiftr,
  set Kdiff := λ n, K (n + 1) \ interior (K n),
  -- Now we restate some properties of `compact_exhaustion` for `K`/`Kdiff`

    simpa only [K'.find_shiftr]

    exact is_open.mem_nhds (K.is_closed n).is_open_compl
      (λ hxKn, hx' $ K.subset_interior_succ _ hxKn) },

  /- Let's cleanup assumption hX a bit -/
  obtain ⟨V, V_op, V_nhds, hPV⟩ :
    ∃ V : X → set X, (∀ x, is_open (V x)) ∧ (∀ x, V x ∈ 𝓝 x) ∧ ∀ x, P (V x),
  { choose V' V'_nhds hPV' using hX,
    exact ⟨λ x, interior (V' x), λ x, is_open_interior, λ x, interior_mem_nhds.mpr (V'_nhds x),
           λ x, hP interior_subset (hPV' x)⟩ },
  /-
  For every `n`, every `x` in `Kdiff n`, consider `W x ∩ (K n)ᶜ`.
  This is an open neighborhood of `x` which doesn't intersect `K n`.
  Because `X` is locally compact, we get a compact neighborhood
  `C x ⊆ W x ∩ (K n)ᶜ`. The interior of all `C x` cover the compact set
  `Kdiff n` so we get a finite subcover indexed by some finite subset of
  `s n ⊆ Kdiff n`. Now we need to gather the `C x` for `x ∈ ⋃ n, s n` to be
  the `u` sequence and the `V x ∩ (K n)ᶜ` to be the `v` sequence.
  I don't know how to tell Lean about this gathering, maybe using some
  encodable/denumerable stuff?

  Then local finiteness should be as in
  refinement_of_locally_compact_sigma_compact_of_nhds_basis_set
