/-- A map between manifolds is an immersion if it is differentiable and its differential at
any point is injective. Note the formalized definition doesn't require differentiability.
If `f` is not differentiable at `m` then, by definition, `mfderiv I I' f m` is zero, which
is not injective unless the source dimension is zero, which implies differentiability. -/
