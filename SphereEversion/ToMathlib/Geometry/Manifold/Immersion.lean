/-! ## Smooth immersions

In this file, we define immersions and prove some of their basic properties.

## Main definitions
* `Immersion I I' f n`: a `C^n` map `f : M → M'` is an immersion iff
its `mfderiv` is injective at each point
* `InjImmersion`: an immersion which is also injective

## Main results


## Implementation notes
The initial design of immersions only assumed injectivity of the differential.
This is not sufficient to ensure immersions are `C^n`:
While mathlib's `mfderiv` has junk value zero when `f` is not differentiable and the zero map is
only injective if `M` has dimension zero (in which case `f` is always `C^n`), this argument only
shows immersions are `MDifferentiable`, not `C^n`.

**NOTE.** This is **not** the correct definition in the infinite-dimensional context,
but in finite dimensions, the general definition is equivalent to the one in this file.
