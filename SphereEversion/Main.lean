/-! # The sphere eversion project

The goal of this project was to formalize Gromov's flexibility theorem for open and ample
partial differential relation. A famous corollary of this theorem is Smale's sphere eversion
theorem: you can turn a sphere inside-out. Let us state this corollary first.

section Smale

-- As usual, we denote by `ℝ³` the Euclidean 3-space and by `𝕊²` its unit sphere.
notation "ℝ³" => EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)

notation "𝕊²" => sphere (0 : ℝ³) 1

-- In the following statements, notation involving `𝓘` and `𝓡` denote smooth structures in the
-- sense of differential geometry.
theorem Smale :
    -- There exists a family of functions `f t` indexed by `ℝ` going from `𝕊²` to `ℝ³` such that
    ∃ f : ℝ → 𝕊² → ℝ³,
    -- it is smooth in both variables (for the obvious smooth structures on `ℝ × 𝕊²` and `ℝ³`) and
    ContMDiff (𝓘(ℝ, ℝ).prod (𝓡 2)) 𝓘(ℝ, ℝ³) ∞ ↿f ∧
    (-- `f 0` is the inclusion map, sending `x` to `x` and
    f 0 = fun x : 𝕊² ↦ (x : ℝ³)) ∧
    (-- `f 1` is the antipodal map, sending `x` to `-x` and
    f 1 = fun x : 𝕊² ↦ -(x : ℝ³)) ∧
    -- every `f t` is an immersion.
    ∀ t, Immersion (𝓡 2) 𝓘(ℝ, ℝ³) (f t) ∞ :=

The above result is an easy corollary of a much more general theorem by Gromov.
The next three paragraphs lines simply introduce three real dimensional manifolds
`M`, `M'` and `P` and assume they are separated and σ-compact. They are rather verbose because
mathlib has a very general theory of manifolds (including manifolds with boundary and corners).
We will consider families of maps from `M` to `M'` parametrized by `P`.
Actually `M'` is assumed to be equipped with a preferred metric space structure in order to make it
easier to state the `𝓒⁰` approximation property.
